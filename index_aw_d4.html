								<h2>Hey there! I’m Talia</h2>
								<p>
									When I’m not teaching this Masterclass I’m helping a select
									number of clients 10X their conversions using this exact
									framework.

								<p>
									After co-founding a conversion optimization agency that
									focuses on emotion, today I run a consulting business and lead

							<h2>
								Why did I turn the method I use in my $20K service into a
								masterclass?
							</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="text-holder">
							<p>
								When I started out as an optimizer, I’d test random stuff based
								on tips I read in blog posts.
							</p>
							<p>
								I followed all sorts of best practices and… basically hoped for
								the best.
							</p>
							<p>But the (lack of) results got me thinking:</p>
							<p>There had to be a better way, right?</p>
							<p>
								A way to consistently help my clients increase their
								conversions.
							</p>
							<p>That’s when I decided to develop my own way.</p>
							<p>
								Once I used this framework to optimize
								<span class="bold-oblique">all</span> of my clients’ websites ,I
								started teaching parts of it on stages at events such as
								<b>MozCon, CTAConf, Google</b> and many others.
							</p>
							<p>
								As I shared this framework (and my optimization struggles) the
								same thing kept coming up over and over…
							</p>
							<p>
								Turns out almost <i>everyone</i> was struggling the way I did.
							</p>
							<p>Everyone was hitting the same problems I used to.</p>
							<p>
								That’s when I realized that it wasn’t enough to just use this
								framework to improve my clients’ results.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is something founders, marketers and agency owners needed
								to learn themselves in order to truly grow their entire
								business.
							</p>
							<p>
								After fielding questions about the process and framework I use
								to <b>10X conversions for my clients</b> I decided to build this
								masterclass.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because I want to help people like me out of the optimization
								hamster wheel.
							</p>
							<p>
								I want to help you get the results you and your clients deserve.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you know me or have seen me on stage, you already know that I
								love to teach, share and empower others.
							</p>
							<p>
								It makes me feel good to help and impact those who
								<span class="bold-oblique">really </span> want to learn and
								become better at what they do. (&lt;-- my emotional drivers)
							</p>
							<p><b>And, yes.</b></p>
							<p>
								<span class="text-underline"
									>I charge clients $20K using this exact framework...</span
									>
							</p>
							<p>
								So imagine what YOU’LL be able to charge in your business OR the
								value you can bring to ANY company.

								WONDERING HOW I CAN HELP YOU ACHIEVE JAW-DROPPING RESULTS IN
								YOUR BUSINESS OR FOR YOUR CLIENTS?

							<p>
								Once you master the method I’ve tested with hundreds of clients,
								you’ll never have to second-guess yourself again.
							</p>
							<ul class="check-list">
								<li>
									You’ll finally hit conversion rates that seemed unimaginable
									only weeks ago.
								</li>

									You’ll build a fiercely loyal community of customers, because
									you’ll finally speak to their emotions, needs, concerns and
									motivations (...and they’ll love you for it).
								</li>
								<li>
									You’ll feel confident when you present your work to clients or
									colleagues, because you’ll be able to defend your choices and
									the process behind it every single time.
